# pands-project
Project for Programming and Scripting project.

Introduction

After reading the project spec (Beatty, 2022) I read the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository information on the Iris Data Set (Fisher, 1936), the link given in the project brief. This lead me to the relevant papers but none of the links given worked for me, so I proceeded to do an online search for each of the papers. The first site I came across, from mirlab (Jyh-Shing, 1996), was very similar to the initial link given but additionally it had some very interesting graphs. The graphs were very helpful in understanding what data was stored and how it was being used to distinguish between the different types of Iris flowers. It also gave me some ideas on what kinds of analysis I should be doing for this project.
At the initial stages of this project I found the prospect of doing analysis on plants daunting as I am the opposite of green-fingered (I often refer to myself as black-fingered) and my gardening knowledge is sparse, at best. On looking at this initial page from mirilab, I am hopefully that garedening knowledge will not be an issue and that I can simply treat the data as I would any raw data.

On further inspection of the mirilab web page it appears to be a page from an online book about Data Clustering and Pattern recognition, which at an early stage seems like it could be helpful in this project.

I researched how to do a scatter plot of 2 columns grouped by another column value using matplot lib and found a way that would allow me add the 3 classes of lilies to one plot using a for loop here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21800004/pandas-for-loop-on-a-group-by

I also found a way to set the Axes labels here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/matplotlib-axes-axes-set_xlabel-in-python/
